# Graphs

### A graph is a common data structure that consists of a finite set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges connecting them.

### Types of graphs:

1. #### Undirected Graph:
2. #### Directed Graph

### Types of Graph Representations:

1. #### Adjacency List
2. #### Adjacency Matrix

## Weighted Graph

### Weighted: In a weighted graph, each edge is assigned a weight or cost.

## Cyclic Graph

### Cyclic: A graph is cyclic if the graph comprises a path that starts from a vertex and ends at the same vertex. That path is called a cycle. An acyclic graph is a graph that has no cycle

### Graph Traversals

1. #### Depth First
2. #### Breadth First
