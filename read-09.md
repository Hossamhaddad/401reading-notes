# Stack and Queue

### Stack is a data structure that stores objects in which the most recently stored objects are the first ones to be remove.

### LIFO: last in, first out

### Queue is a data structure that stores objects in which the most stored objects are the first ones to be removed.

### FIFO : first in first out

### Operations that can be performed on the stack:

1. #### push : elements are inserted at the top of the stack
2. #### pop : elements are deleted from the top of the stack
3. #### IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
4. #### IsFull: Check if the stack is full
5. #### Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it

### Technical words for insertion and deletion in queue:

1. #### enqueue
2. #### dequeue

### There are two similarities between the stack and queue :

1. #### Flexible in size
2. #### Linear data structure

### Stacks advantages :

1. #### Not easily corrupted.
2. #### Variables cannot be resized.
3. #### It allows you to control how memory is allocated and deallocated.
