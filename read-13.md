# Trees

### A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges .

### tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure.

### Tree Terminologies:

1. #### Node :A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes.
2. #### Root : It is the topmost node of a tree.
3. #### Edge :It is the link between any two nodes.
4. #### Height of a Node :The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf
5. #### Depth of a Node:depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node
6. #### Height of a Tree :The height of a Tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.

### Tree Traversing ways :

1. #### Depth First
2. #### Breadth First

### Tree types :

1. #### Binary Trees
2. #### Binary Search Trees
3. #### K-ary Trees.

### Tree Applications

1. #### Binary Search Trees(BSTs) are used to quickly check whether an element is present in a set or not
2. #### Heap is a kind of tree that is used for heap sort
3. #### A modified version of a tree called Tries is used in modern routers to store routing information
