# Object Oriented Programming

## object oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

## Objectoriented programming advantages:

1. ### Faster and easier to execute
2. ### Clear structure for the programs
3. ### Makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
4. ### Create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

## Class : A Class is like an object constructor for creating objects

## Object : An object is a member or an instance of a class

## The java file name should be like the class name .

## Returning a Value from a Method :

### A method returns to the code that invoked it when it

1. ### completes all the statements in the method,
2. ### reaches a return statement, or
3. ### throws an exception (covered later)

# Numbers :

## Binary : Represent any number using 2 digits (0–1) only

## Decimal : Represent any number using 10 digits (0–9) , when we have ten different symbols, when we add digits to the left side of a number, each position is going to worth 10 times more than it’s previous one.

## Hexadecimal : in hexadecimal there are only 16 symbols or possible digit values, there are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.

### Hexadecimal Number System is commonly used in Computer programming and Microprocessors.
