# SOLID Principles

## The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design, set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure .

## SOLID Principles

1. ### The Single Responsibility Principle

2. ### The Open-Closed Principle

3. ### The Liskov Substitution Principle

4. ### The Interface Segregation Principle

5. ### The Dependency Inversion Principle

## The Single Responsibility Principle :class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.

## The Open-Closed Principle requires that classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.

## The Liskov Substitution Principle states that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

## Interface Segregation Principle :Segregation means keeping things separated, and the Interface Segregation Principle is about separating the interfaces.

## The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions
