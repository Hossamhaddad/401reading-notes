# Linked Lists

## linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

## Linked list types :

1. ### Singly : Item navigation is forward only.
2. ### Doubly : Items can be navigated forward and backward.

## Nodes: Nodes are the individual items inside a linked list consist of data and reference to the next node .

## the address of the first node has special name called HEAD

### We cant use forEach and for loop when we want to traverse a linked lists

## Big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements .

## Linked List Advantages :

1. ### Dynamic data structure
2. ### No memory wastage
3. ### Implementation
4. ### Insertion and Deletion Operations

## Linked List Disadvantages :

1. ### Use more memory
2. ### Slow Search Time
3. ### Slow Traversal
