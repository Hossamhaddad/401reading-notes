# Java

## Java:is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible .

## Java Language Basics

### 1. Variables

### 2. Operators

### 3. Expressions

### 4. Statements

### 5. Blocks

## Primitive Data Types

### 1. byte

### 2. short

### 3. integer

### 4. long

### 5. float

### 6. double

### 7. boolean

### 8. char

### 9. string

## Array :is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

### To declare array of integer for example (int[] anArray;) we have to choose the datatype of the arrray we can use float, boolean , string ... etc .

## Java Operators :

### Java Operators examples :

### 1.additive (+ , - )

### 2. equality (== ,!=)

### 3. logical AND &&

### 4. logical OR ||

### 5. assignment (= , += ,-= ,\*=)

## Control Flow Statements

## Java compiler executes the java code from top to bottom. The statements are executed according to the order in which they appear.

## There are 3 types of control flow statements supported by the Java programming language.

1. ### Decision-making statements
2. ### Looping statements
3. ### Branching statements

### The if-then statement is the most basic of all the control flow statements. It tells your program to execute a certain section of code only if a particular test evaluates to true.

## Java compiler :

### the compiler takes code that you can write and understand and translates it into code that a computer can execute.

### Compilerâ€™s main functionality is to convert High level language to low level language which is understand by the machine.
