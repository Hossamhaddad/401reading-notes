# Java

## Java:is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible .

## Java Language Basics

### 1. Variables

### 2. Operators

### 3. Expressions

### 4. Statements

### 5. Blocks

## Primitive Data Types

### 1. byte

### 2. short

### 3. integer

### 4. long

### 5. float

### 6. double

### 7. boolean

### 8. char

### 9. string

## Array :is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

### To declare array of integer for example (int[] anArray;) we have to choose the datatype of the arrray we can use float, boolean , string ... etc .

## Java Operators :

### Java Operators examples :

### 1.additive (+ , - )

### 2. equality (== ,!=)

### 3. logical AND &&

### 4. logical OR ||

### 5. assignment (= , += ,-= ,\*=)

## Control Flow Statements

### The statements inside your source files are generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear. Control flow statements, however, break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.

### The if-then statement is the most basic of all the control flow statements. It tells your program to execute a certain section of code only if a particular test evaluates to true.

## Java compiler :

### the compiler takes code that you can write and understand and translates it into code that a computer can execute.

### Compilerâ€™s main functionality is to convert High level language to low level language which is understand by the machine.
