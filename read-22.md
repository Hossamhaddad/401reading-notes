# Hash Table

### Hash table is one of the most important data structures that uses a special function known as a hash function that maps a given value with a key to access the elements faster.

### A Hash table is a data structure that stores some information, and the information has basically two main components, i.e., key and value.

### Hash function assigns each value with a unique key. Sometimes hash table uses an imperfect hash function that causes a collision because the hash function generates the same key of two different values.

### There are three ways of calculating the hash function:

1. #### Division method
2. #### Folding method
3. #### Mid square method

### Collision :When the two different values have the same value, then the problem occurs between the two values, known as a collision.
