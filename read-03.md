# Java Maps, primitives and File I/O

## Java Type System:

### Java's type system involves classes and primitive types, also other kinds of reference types .

## primitive type variables impact on the memory examples :

1. ### boolean – 1 bit
2. ### byte – 8 bits
3. ### long, double – 64 bits
4. ### int, float – 32 bits

## reference type objects impact on the memory examples :

1. ### Long, Double – 192 bits
2. ### Integer, Float – 128 bits
3. ### Short, Character – 128 bits
4. ### Boolean – 128 bits

### arrays of the primitive types long and double consume more memory than reference classes Long and Double.

## primitive types are much faster and require much less memory so we prefer to use them more than refrence .

## Exception : When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an exception object, contains information about the error

## Exception handler :

1. ### try
2. ### catch
3. ### throw
4. ### throws
5. ### finally

## Exceptions Kinds :

1. ### Checked Exception
2. ### Error
3. ### Runtime Exception

## Scanning

### Objects of type Scanner are useful for breaking down formatted input into tokens and translating individual tokens according to their data type.
